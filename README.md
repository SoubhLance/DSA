- **Trees** - Binary trees, BST, AVL, segment trees
- **Graphs** - Representation, traversal algorithms
- **Heaps** - Min/max heaps, priority queues
- **Hash Tables** - Implementation and collision handling
- **Tries** - Prefix trees for string operations

### Algorithms
- **Sorting** - Bubble, merge, quick, heap sort
- **Searching** - Binary search and variants
- **Dynamic Programming** - Classic problems and optimization
- **Greedy Algorithms** - Activity selection, fractional knapsack
- **Graph Algorithms** - DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall
- **Backtracking** - N-Queens, Sudoku solver
- **Divide & Conquer** - Merge sort, quick sort applications

## 🎯 Difficulty Levels

- **Basic** - Fundamental operations and simple problems
- **Intermediate** - Standard interview questions
