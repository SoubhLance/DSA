### Array Programs in C/C++
- A collection of C programs demonstrating various array operations and manipulations.
_____________________
## array1.c
-> Initializing an Array and then displaying it  
-> WAP  to read and display n numbers using an array

## array2.c
-> Initializing the array with even numbers and odd numbers

## array3,c
-> WAP to read and display n random integers in an array

## array4.c
-> WAP to print the position of the smallest of n numbers in an array

## array5.c
-> WAP to interchange the smallest and the largest number

## array6.c
-> WAP to find the second largest number using array of n numbers 

## array7.c
```
    Exercise 5.5
    Data[] is an array that is declared as int Data[20] and contains the following values:
    Data[] = {12, 23, 34, 45, 56, 67, 78, 89, 90, 100}
    (a) Calculate the length of the array.
    (b) Find the upper bound and lower bound.
    (c) Show the memory representation of the array.
    (d) If a new data element with value 75 has to be inserted, find its position.
    (e) Insert the new data element and then show the memory representation of the array.
```

## array8.c
-> WAP to insert a number at a given location

## array9.c
-> WAP to insert a number in an array that is already sorted in ascending order

## array10.c
-> WAP to insert a number in an array that is already sorted in dexending order
